Mapping cat 
Mapping cat 
after reading the description and going through the refence material I understood that 
Nmap(Network Mapper) it is a linux command line tool which is used to scan IP address and ports in a network, it allows us to know about the open ports and 
services 
why use nmap??
it helps us to check if the host is up it supports simple comands
after using the comand nmap 43.205.129.227(given IP adress)
i got to know that there are 4 open ports 
after that i used agressive scanning since nmap has an agressive mode it enables script scanning(-sC) and OS detection(-O) version detection(-sV) and traceroute(-traceroute)
after that i got 4 open ports(21,22,552,6969) and in the two ports(554,6969) i got harry's port which was 969 and as given in the flag format 
which is p3nt35t{no.of.open.ports_harry's_port} since there are 4 open ports+2harry's ports running total open ports=6
therefor the flag format would be p3nt35t{6_969}




nc port (netcat port) it is a powerfull networking tool it acts like a cat command over network it allows users to read and write data over a network connection
