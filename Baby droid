- I got the flag format p3nt35t{droid_RW5pZ21hCg_ZG4zY3NA_21wsmkla10o} and by decoding the middle two words(base64) we get RW5pZ21hCg-Enigma and 
ZG4zY3NA-dn3cs@ and by the information given in the java code the final code that we get is 
p3nt35t{droid_Enigma_@sc3nd_21wsmkla10o} and by submitting it in the decript me app which we get from clicking on the instance in an android phone
