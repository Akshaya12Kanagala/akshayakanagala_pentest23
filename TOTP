TOTP- Time based one time password
TOTP is a computer based alogorithm that generates one time password using the current time
the inputs include a shared secret key and the system time.  and as given in the description i got a hunch and after opening the instance and looked for cookies and found the secret key.
The clue that i got in cookie TVJCVzZaREZFQkJHQzQzRkdNWkE= after searching about this code i understood that it is a base64 decoder and i decoded it in https://www.base64decode.org/ i got the code MRBW6ZDFEBBGC43FGMZA 
After that i researced about how to get the 6 digit OTP code after getting the secret code and found a way where i can get the opt throught linux command 
which is -oathtool -b --totp "secret code"
oathtool is a command used for working with OTPs -b specifies that otp should be given in otp format -totp is to generate otp based on the time which 
would change for every 30 or 60 seconds
after using the command i got the 6 digit code 043676 afterwards i put the code and got the flag p3nt35t{T1m3_Tr4v3l3r_T0k3n}
