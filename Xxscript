After reading the description and going through the payloads, I found the java script alert codes which was given as a clue in the description and  
by going through the website, I started submitting the java script payloads and after submitting the <script src=javascript:alert(1)> the background changed and then I got the 
flag and by using the same <script src=javascript:alert(1)> I got the flag 2 as well and for the flag 3 i did not get it and I tried using the other 
javascript alert payloads and after few tries and using the <a href=javascript:alert(1)> I got the third flag and submitted it 

JavaScript payload formatters allow you to write functions to encode or decode messages
falg 1    p3nt35t{IAmTh3S3n4t3}
flag 2    p3nt35t{W3r3D00m3d}
flag 3    p3nt35t{Its0v3rAn4k1n}
